This repo contains info around major/notable changes in Node.js versions to help others migrate.

This repo includes list of all major changes in 
- 6.0.0
- 8.0.0
- 9.0.0
- 10.0.0

Node.js versions changes are cumulative.
So, If you are planning to upgrade from 4.x to 10.x, you should take a look at all changes in 6.0.0 + 8.0.0 + 9.0.0 + 10.0.0.

Similary if you plan to upgrade from 4.x to 6.x, you should only chack changes in 6.0.0.

MAJOR CHANGES LIST: [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)


I tried to add all major changes from node/changelog, but incase I missed something, feel free to open a PR.
